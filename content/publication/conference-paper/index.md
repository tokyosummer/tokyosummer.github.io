abstract: Nearly three years after the first outbreak, China relaxed its Zero-Covid policy.
During the period of strict control, some local officials flexibly achieved both pandemic
control and economic recovery with targeted measures, while others insisted on stringent
policies with large-scale lockdowns even when the number of infected cases was low. Under
the uniform Zero-Covid policy, why did subnational governments facing a similar level of
infection adopt different lockdown decisions? This study argues that state capacity is key to
understanding heterogeneity in policy choice. Specifically, using a novel dateset covering 281
Chinese cities, this study provides robust evidence for these arguments. Firstly, contrary to
expectations, fiscal capacity, typically considered a conventional dimension of state capacity,
does not significantly influence lockdown decisions. Similarly, capacity less directly related
to achieving the policy goal, such as monitoring capacity, also do not explain the variation.
Secondly, medical capacity, closely aligned with the policy goal, explains the variation: cities
with weaker medical capacity, i.e., fewer doctors for achieving pandemic control, are more
likely to prefer strict measures with large-scale lockdowns, while high-capacity cities prefer
targeted measures with small-scale lockdowns. Thirdly, different dimensions of capacity are not necessarily correlated: cities with strong fiscal capacity do not necessarily have strong
medical capacity. In summary, state capacity is multidimensional and varies across localities,
with heterogeneity in policy implementation shaped by capacity contingent on the policy
goal, especially in times of crisis.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Capacity constraints are key to understanding policy implementation particularly during the crisis time.
